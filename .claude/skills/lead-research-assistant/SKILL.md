Licence: `.claude/skills/_vendor/LICENSE-claude-code-templates.txt`. The SHIVAS notes below were added for this project.

## SHIVAS notes (read first)
- This is the SHIVAS group website (`site/`, plain HTML): B2B engineering for galvanizing plants, wire drawing machines,
  PP/FRP tanks, scrubbers, pickling, ETP/ZLD and FRP profiles. Buyers are plant owners, engineers and purchase heads,
  mostly in India, some abroad. There are no sign-ups, trials, pricing tiers or checkout: ignore that advice below.
- **The facts rules in `CLAUDE.md` win over anything below.** Never invent testimonials, client names or logos,
  customer counts, ratings, certificates, "as seen in", guarantees or urgency. Use only facts already on the site or
  supplied by the owner; a missing fact becomes `[bracketed]` and goes into `docs/content-checklist.md`.
- Make changes the way the `site-edit` skill says (keep the shared division pages in step), then run
  `python3 tools/check_site.py`, `node tools/a11y.cjs` on the pages changed, and screenshot them (`site-preview`).
- SHIVAS's buyers: job galvanizers and companies that galvanize their own steel (transmission towers, poles, solar
  mounting structures, crash barriers, fasteners, pipes), wire and wire-product makers, steel processors that
  pickle steel, and plants needing effluent treatment or ZLD. India first; export markets where the owner says so.
- Research public company information only. Don't collect personal phone numbers or private emails, don't scrape
  LinkedIn, and don't state or imply that a company is a SHIVAS customer. Mark anything unverified as such.
- Hand the shortlist to the installed Sales plugin (account-research, draft-outreach) for follow-up; outreach goes
  out only after the owner approves it.
